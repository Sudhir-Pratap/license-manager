# ðŸ”§ License Manager Package - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified & Fixed âœ…

### 1. âœ… Laravel 12 Compatibility
**Problem:** Package only supported Laravel 9-11, but license-server uses Laravel 12
**Fix:** Updated all illuminate packages to support `^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0`

### 2. âœ… Missing illuminate/filesystem Dependency
**Problem:** Code uses `Illuminate\Support\Facades\File` but dependency wasn't declared
**Fix:** Added `"illuminate/filesystem": "^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0"`

### 3. âœ… Missing illuminate/database Dependency
**Problem:** AntiPiracyManager uses `Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB` but dependency wasn't declared
**Fix:** Added `"illuminate/database": "^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0"`

### 4. âœ… Symfony 7 Compatibility
**Problem:** Package required Symfony 6 only, but Laravel 12 uses Symfony 7
**Fix:** Updated to `"symfony/http-foundation": "^6.0|^7.0"`

### 5. âœ… LicenseManager Not Registered
**Problem:** Service provider tried to inject LicenseManager without registering it first
**Fix:** Added singleton registration for LicenseManager before AntiPiracyManager

### 6. âœ… PHP Version Support
**Problem:** Only PHP 8.1 was supported
**Fix:** Extended to support `"php": "^8.1|^8.2|^8.3"`

### 7. âœ… Test Scripts Fixed
**Problem:** Test scripts tried to install from Packagist (package not published)
**Fix:** Updated to use local path installation with proper error handling

### 8. âœ… Carbon Dependency (Not Needed)
**Status:** Initially thought missing, but Carbon is already included with Laravel
**Action:** No changes needed - using Laravel's bundled Carbon
